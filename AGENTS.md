# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- Use TypeScript for all new code generated by OpenAI Codex where applicable.
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the codebase.
- Ensure that all new code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality.
- Write unit Pest tests for all new functionality to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Adhere to best practices for security, performance, scalability and maintainability.
- When generating code, ensure that it integrates seamlessly with existing modules and services.
- Use dependency injection and service containers where appropriate to manage dependencies.
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns to ensure clean and modular code.
- Ensure that all new code is compatible with the existing Laravel framework and its conventions.
- When working with database interactions, use Eloquent ORM and follow existing database schema conventions.
- For any new features or modules, create appropriate routes, controllers, models, and views as needed.
- Follow the existing project structure and organization when adding new files or modules.
- Use version control best practices, including meaningful commit messages and branching strategies.
- For testing, use base_path('.tmp') as the temporary directory to avoid conflicts with existing files. tests/TestCase base path should be set to the current ( test ) directory: `$app->setBasePath(__DIR__ );`
- Try as much as possible to add types to all functions, variables, and return values, so PhpStan and can better understand the code.
