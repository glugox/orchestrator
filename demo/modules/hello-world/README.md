# Hello World Module

This module is packaged as a Composer installable Laravel module that integrates
with the Orchestrator package. It exposes a single JSON API endpoint that can be
used to verify that the sandbox bootstrap process worked correctly.

Once installed inside a Laravel application, you can hit `/api/hello-world` to
receive a friendly JSON message.
